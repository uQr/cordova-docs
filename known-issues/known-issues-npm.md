#**Known Issues - NPM**
**NPM Proxy Errors**

If NPM packages aren't installing properly, and you see an error that mentions bad characters in a request, the most likely cause is that there is a proxy/firewall interfering. To fix the issue, execute the following on the command prompt:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~
npm config set proxy http://proxydomain:port/
npm config set registry http://registry.npmjs.org/
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
