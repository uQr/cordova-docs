#Automate tasks for your Cordova project by using Gulp
**Note that this documentation applies to Visual Studio 2015 and does not apply to Visual Studio 2013 CTPs.**

[Gulp](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=533803) is an increasingly popular JavaScript based task runner with a large number of [useful plugins](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=533790) designed to automate common “tasks” for everything from compilation, to packaging, deployment, or simply copying files around. Both Gulp and the [Apache Cordova Command Line interface](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=533773) (CLI) are Node.js based which makes the two highly complementary technologies. In this tutorial we will cover a few ways Gulp can be used with Cordova:

1.  [Using Gulp to Build Cordova Projects](gulp-ci.md) - Includes information on using Gulp in a Team / CI Environment
2.  [Invoking Gulp Tasks During a Cordova Build and the VS Task Runner Explorer](gulp-task-runner-explorer.md)
3.  [Compiling TypeScript](tutorial-typescript.md)
